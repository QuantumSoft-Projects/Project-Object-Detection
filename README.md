# Multi-Modal AI Detection System

This project is a real-time computer vision system that combines object detection, hand gesture recognition, gender classification, age estimation, and emotion detection using multiple deep learning models and OpenCV. It processes webcam input to deliver rich insights on human behavior.

## Features

- YOLOv3 for object detection
- Gender classification using Caffe models
- Age estimation with confidence smoothing
- Emotion detection using DeepFace
- Hand gesture recognition with MediaPipe
